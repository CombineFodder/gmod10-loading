# Garry's Mod 10 Loading Screen
Garry's Mod 10 Loading Screen Revival by Freezebug

## Introduction
Well, if you're anything like me, you thought that the Garry's Mod 10 loading screen was brilliant. So I've decided to pull a backup of my old GMod 10 files, and rip the loading screen files out of it.

After a short episode of patching them up, I've gotten rather pleasing results.

Do note that once you install this, servers' custom loading screens (sv_loadingurl) loading screens will no longer work; you will not be able to load HTML on a loading screen.

Enjoy your Garry's Mod 10 nostalgia.

## Installation
Do note that you **must install this in your root garrysmod folder**.

This means you must extract the zip into garrysmod/garrysmod/.

It will probably ask to overwrite one file when you paste / extract it; make sure to say yes.

## Uninstallation
Download the default loading.lua file from [the official Garry's Mod repository](https://github.com/garrynewman/garrysmod/tree/master/garrysmod/lua/menu) and overwrite your loading.lua with this new one.

You can then delete the "loading" subfolder of lua/menu/.
